(** "Let [L] be a list of even natural numbers"
    is naturally translated as a quantification over a value of type [list nat],
    with an additional constraint on the values stored in the list. *)

Definition example_list_even_nat :=
  forall (L : list nat), LibList.Forall even L -> True.

(** "Let [L] be a list of positive natural numbers"
    if we follow the scheme of the previous example, we get: *)

Definition example_list_pos_nat :=
  forall (L : list nat), LibList.Forall (fun v => v > 0) L -> True.

(** In other words, there is no reason to come up with a new type [natpos]
    for nonnegative numbers, and quantify over [L : list natpos]. *)

(** "Let [L] be a list of natural numbers whose length is between 5 and 7"
    is, again, naturally translated as a quantification over a value of type
    [list nat], with an additional constraint on the list. *)

Definition example_list_nat_bounded :=

(** In other words, there is no reason to come up with a new dependent type
    [list n nat] for lists of [n] values of type [nat]. *)

(** "Let [n] be a list of length [5]"
    involves an implicit quantification over the type of the list.
    If we are explicit, in type theory, we would write: *)

Definition example_list_poly :=
  forall (A : Type) (L : list A), (length L = 5) -> True.

(** If we want to leave the quantification over the type explicit, we would
    need a mechanism that generalizes "Implicit Types". I would like to write:
[[

(** "A set S equipped with a binary operation [S x S -> S], and with member
    an identity element is a monoid if it satisfies the two axioms
    (associativity and identity element)."

    Here, the set [S] is of unspecified type, so let us apply the previous
    scheme of assuming an implicit quantification of a type [A] for the elements.
    Consider for example the monoid [2Z], made of even integers; its carrier
    type is [Z], but its elements are only the subset of even integers.

    We could attempt to formalize this directly as a predicate
    [monoid S id op]. But instead of carrying [S], [id] and [op] as three
    separate components everywhere, let us first introduce a type for the
    set equipped with its identity element and its binary operation. *)

(** Monoid over full types *)

(** [Z] is a communative monoid for [0] and [+]. In this monoid, the type [A] of elements

(** This example shows that we can mimic the mathematical writing of

(** Lifting of results *)

    for monoids over full types into results that hold for all monoids. *)

(** * Overloading *)

(** I would like Coq to benefit from ADA and PVS style resolution of overloading.

    In those systems, resolution is directed both by the type of function arguments
    and the type expected by the context, using a two-pass typing algorithm
    (bottom-up, then top-down). I will soon work on extending the
    algorithm form ADA and PVS to support polymorphism.

    For the moment, let me approximate this feature by using:
    - typeclass for parsing and resolving overloaded symbols
    - immediate call to "simpl" to remove the typeclass indirection
    - use of printing-only notation for printing the overloaded symbols. *)

(**  Assume the notation "forall (x st P), .."  means "forall x, P x -> ..".
     Assume that "0" can be viewed as a variable name (overloaded),
     and that "+", when it appears in the position of a binder,
     can be viewed as a a variable name alias for the operator "plus".
     We could write the previous statement as:

[[
Autoquantify (A : Type).
Implicit Types (M : Monoid_str A).

Lemma example_comm_Monoid :
  forall (M st comm_monoid), let (0,+) := M in
  forall x, '0 '+ x = x.
]]
*)

(**  We could even try to go further, using the "as" syntax from pattern matching:
[[
  forall ((0,+) as M st comm_monoid)
]]

or introduce a new syntax for "as", closer to the standard mathematical notation.
[[
  forall (M(0,+) st comm_monoid)
]]
